## Project Description

Company Website for GreenGlow Goods

## Team Members:

| Last Name   | First Name | Role                     |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------|
| Novis       | Rebecca    | Web Designer             |
| Ho          | JC         | Web Developer            |

## Summary
JC acted as the primary developer, while Rebecca acted as the primary designer. JC and Rebecca first agreed on the general layout of the pages. Rebecca then started work on the color pallet, while JC started working on the base layout of the project. As Rebecca worked on designing different sections of each page, JC worked on implementing the section of the design Rebecca finished into the actual website. 

## Tools & Resources
Figma was used to design the website.
http://colormind.io/bootstrap/ was used to assist with creating the color pallet
The website was programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Procreate was used to create the logo
GoogleFonts was used for fonts
FontAwesome was used for Icons

## Testing & Challenges
We faced challenges with the time given. We found ourselves running out of time to implement everything near the end. Rebecca had some difficulty designing a logo, as she isn't as practiced with logo design. Rebecca faced some challenges with trying to maintain consistency with elements like buttons across the project. Although not perfect, she tried to give them all a similar shape, so even if they had different colors they would still read as buttons. JC also gave them a pointer cursor over each button to reinforce that they were buttons. 

## SkillsUSA Reflection
Our project reflects the client's values of environmental responsibility by using colors associated with nature, reinforcing their ties to the environment. We made sure to incorporate their mission statement at the very top of the home page, to make sure the goal of the company was front and center. 
It also illustrates SkillsUSA's theme of Igniting Your Potential, by encouraging the user/consumer to embrace their potential to act with the environment in mind.
